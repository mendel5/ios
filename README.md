## Restart an iPhone/iPad: Don't do a force restart!
### Normal restart

### Why not to do a force restart

> A force restart is at the hardware level, not the software level. \[A force restart] does nothing more than cut the power and turn the device back on again.
>
> **This means that \[a force restart] doesn't clear any caches or reset anything. A regular restart actually does more than a force restart.**

> \[A force restart] is the equivalent on a PC or Mac as powering it off with the power switch, rather than the Shutdown procedure. It terminates all running apps without allowing them to "clean up" any process in progress, so it can cause data loss in apps that are running (just like it can on a computer). But it won’t cause any damage to hardware or iOS.
> 
> **The better way to restart (unless the phone is frozen) is to shut down, then start. This gives apps a chance to clean up.**

> **Contrary to a lot of other articles, a force restart does not reset your phone "more" than the conventional way of restarting**. Force restarting your device will deliberately cut off the power from your phone's battery to its hardware. This will cause your phone to lose power and shut down.

> The problem with \[a force restart] is not rooted in what it can do, but in how it's sold as a tech fix. It's very common to find articles online that like to sell force restarting as a "better way" to restart your phone. In reality, this is completely false.
> 
> In contrast, a conventional restart is a systematic process that makes sure all your programs/software applications are closed before your operating system. Any background processes will save and exit securely.
