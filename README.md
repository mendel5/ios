### Why not to do a forced restart

> A force restart is at the hardware level, not the software level. \[A force restart] does nothing more than cut the power and turn the device back on again. **This means that \[a force restart] doesn't clear any caches or reset anything. A regular restart actually does more than a force restart.**

> \[A force restart] is the equivalent on a PC or Mac as powering it off with the power switch, rather than the Shutdown procedure. It terminates all running apps without allowing them to "clean up" any process in progress, so it can cause data loss in apps that are running (just like it can on a computer). But it won’t cause any damage to hardware or iOS.
> **The better way to restart (unless the phone is frozen) is to shut down, then start. This gives apps a chance to clean up.**
